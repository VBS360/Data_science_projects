### Problem Description

Predicting air ticket prices is a complex challenge in the aviation industry due to the dynamic nature of pricing strategies employed by airlines. These prices are influenced by various factors, including demand fluctuations, seasonal trends, flight duration, and the specific route taken by the flight. Accurately forecasting these prices is essential for both airlines, which seek to optimize revenue, and passengers, who aim to find the best possible deals.

### Business Problem

The Indian aviation industry is experiencing rapid growth, with an increasing number of flights and passengers each year. However, the dynamic pricing of air tickets presents a significant challenge for airlines in maximizing their revenue and for passengers in securing affordable prices. Traditional pricing models often fall short in addressing the complexities of these factors, leading to missed opportunities and suboptimal pricing strategies.

### Key Goals Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts air ticket prices for domestic flights within India. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes various flight characteristics, the model aims to identify the key factors that influence pricing and provide actionable insights for both airlines and passengers.

1. **Predict Air Ticket Prices**: Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately forecasting the price of air tickets based on multiple influencing factors. This will help airlines optimize their pricing strategies and assist passengers in making informed purchasing decisions.

2. **Identify Pricing Influencers**: Analyze the factors that significantly impact air ticket pricing, such as the time of booking, flight duration, number of stops, and airline reputation. Understanding these influencers will provide deeper insights into the dynamics of airfare pricing.

3. **Enhance Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights that can be used by stakeholders, such as airlines and passengers, to enhance their decision-making processes. Airlines can adjust their pricing strategies in real-time, while passengers can plan their purchases to secure the best deals.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about various flights, such as the airline, date of journey, source and destination cities, flight duration, total stops, and ticket price. By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends that influence air ticket pricing and develop a robust predictive model to forecast future prices. This model will provide valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies and improving decision-making processes in the aviation industry.
